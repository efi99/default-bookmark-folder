### Features

**Firefox built-in bookmarking:**

*You can:*
- Select where the new bookmarks will be added
- Choose to add the new bookmarks to the top or the bottom of the selected folder
- Choose to add the new bookmarks to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)

- Choose to add the new folders of bookmarked tabs to the top or the bottom of the selected folder
- Choose to add the new folders of bookmarked tabs to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)

**Quick bookmark icon:**

This feature will add a quick bookmark icon in the address bar, to (un)bookmark a page with only one click.
The icon is a round star icon in the address bar.
If the current page is bookmarked, the icon color will change to red.

*You can:*
- Enable the quick bookmark shortcut (Alt+Shift+D)
- Select where the new bookmarks will be added
- Choose to add the new bookmarks to the top or the bottom of the selected folder
- Choose to add the new bookmarks to the last used folder (by any bookmarking or sorting method)
- Choose to show the page as bookmarked (i.e. the icon color changes) only if all the bookmarks of this page are in the folder you selected
- Select the color of the quick bookmark icon (among a list) when the current page is bookmarked (red by default)

**Quick bookmarking to folder:**

Access this feature via the extension browser action (toolbar icon) or via its dedicated shortcut (Alt+Shift+M).

It will allow you to search and select a specific folder within your bookmarks to quickly bookmark the current page into it.
